# neetcode-150-roadmap

## Problems Completed ✅:  
  ### Arrays and Hashing : 4
  ### Stack: 0
  ### Two Pointers: 0
  ### Linked List: 0
  ### Binary Search: 0
  ### Sliding Window: 0

#### Day 3 ✅ Found out that to reinforce my Array and Hashing understand it's best that I create documentation for these data structures, understanding why certain data structures are useful, and repetition in order to remember when to call them.

#### Steps to Problem Solving
##### 1. Problem Definition (understand what the problem is asking and write it down, what are the deliverables?)
##### 2. Understand the Brute Force Solution and find patterns that could be used to find the optimized solution (the first, unoptimized solution should be understood, and then we should find patterns that are in the brute force solutions to trim the problem down to it's optimized form).
##### 3. Once we understand the patterns that can be used, optimize problem and solve.
##### 4. Debug and check for space and time complexity, understand how the problem would unravel into the solution over it's runtime.
