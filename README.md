## Problems Completed ✅:  
  ### Arrays and Hashing : 4
  ### Stack: 0
  ### Two Pointers: 0
  ### Linked List: 0
  ### Binary Search: 0
  ### Sliding Window: 0

#### Day 3 ✅ Still Looking to Reinforce my understanding of the the Array and Hashing Data Structures. I am struggling to fully understand questions before solving them, so I need to work on using the 4 steps created by me in order to solve leetcode problems.

#### Steps to Problem Solving
##### 1. Problem Definition (understand what the problem is asking and write it down, what are the deliverables?)
##### 2. Understand the Brute Force Solution and find patterns that could be used to find the optimized solution (the first, unoptimized solution should be understood, and then we should find patterns that are in the brute force solutions to trim the problem down to it's optimized form).
##### 3. Once we understand the patterns that can be used, optimize problem and solve.
##### 4. Debug and check for space and time complexity, understand how the problem would unravel into the solution over it's runtime.
